## Usage Instructions:
1. Adjust the sliders for height and mass to your measurements.
2. Observe the BMI values generated in the respective tabs for WHO and Asia-Pacific standards.
3. Interpret the results based on the color-coded regions on the plot:
    - <span style="color: red;"><strong>Red:</strong></span> Indicates obese.
    - <span style="color: palegreen;"><strong>Pale Green:</strong></span> Indicates normal weight.
    - <span style="color: cornflowerblue;"><strong>Cornflower Blue:</strong></span> Indicates overweight.
    - <span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Yellow:</strong></span> Indicates underweight.
4. Explore the 3D scatter plot to visualize the relationship between height, weight, and BMI. Each point represents a combination of height and weight, with the color indicating the corresponding BMI value.

The BMI values should fall within the specified ranges according to WHO and Asia-Pacific standards for healthy weight.

### Obesity classification according to WHO and Asia-Pacific guidelines
